# LegalNegBERT 
This repository contains the [annotation guidelines](Annotation_Guidelines.pdf) for the annotation of the [MuliLegalNeg dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/rcds/MultiLegalNeg) and the code to finetune negation models based on this data.

A pre-trained model is available on [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/rcds/neg-xlm-roberta-base). See [LegalNegBERT](LegalNegBERT.ipynb) for how this model was trained and how to use it.
